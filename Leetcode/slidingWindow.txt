滑动窗口伪代码框架 

def slidingWindow(s: str):
    window = ...
    left, right = 0, 0
    while right < len(s):
        c = s[right]
        window.add(c)
        right += 1
        ...

        while left < right and window need shrink:
            d = s[left]
            window.remove(d)
            left+=1
            ...

1. when to move right, after move, update which data
2. when window need shrink, after move left, update which data
3. when to update result
